Wordpress Json Api
===

I have modified the wordpress-plugin that can originally be found here:
http://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/

I have added a "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *"-header to avoid terrible headache. I mean, who want access control to this API? :)
If you like this plugin, please consider donating to the original author!
